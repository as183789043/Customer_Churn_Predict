# Customer_Churn_Predict

## Overview

Customer retention is one of the most important key performance indicators (KPI) for companies with a subscription-based business model. Retaining customers can significantly reduce churn, enhance lifetime value, and improve overall profitability. 

In this project, we aim to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are at risk of leaving (churn) based on historical data. This will allow companies to take proactive measures to retain these customers and reduce churn rates.
